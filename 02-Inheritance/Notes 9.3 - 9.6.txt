Overriding methods occurs when a child class modify the public method from it's parent class and make it as it's own method(overriding it).
(To override a inherited method, the child class must consist of the method with the same method name)

Overriding and Overloading are not the same thing;  Overloading a method is when several methods have the same name but the parameter types, order, 
or number are different.
